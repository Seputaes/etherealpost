## Contributing

When I set out to create this project, it was intended to be fully open to the community,
with no restrictions other than the open source licenses which cover the code. I've started
this project at least 3 times in the past, using different languages and technologies, but none
ever came to light. Since I've been wanting to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), 
this project gave me a perfect opportunity to develop those skills with a real world problem.

But the core goal I've had in mind the past few years is to encourage community participation 
in this project so that it can be a premier library for World of Warcraft auction house analytics.

If there's any missing features, bugs, or otherwise inefficiencies that you feel would make
this project better, please do open an [issue](https://github.com/seputaes/etherealpost/issues).
